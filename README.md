# Typescript app project

This app has been created as project-purpose only for Start2Impact.

Technology used: **Typescript**

The project wants to create an _educational system_ where pertecipants can enroll to courses and get offered positions from companies based on the studies they had.

The approach to this project has been taken by using classes:
in particular 3 classes have been created: IPertecipant, ICourse, ICompany. They all have implemented 3 interfaces, to make the code more robust and clear.

The first class shows all the partecipants data that thanks to a method it gets enrolled to a course and added to an array through the method addPartecipant.

The class company will have an array of available positions where the partecipants can apply to, bases on the studies the attended.

The code is Typescript only.
